Cadent FED React-Reduct Exercise

The main points of change in this project were the App.js (I changed the title of the page)

The index.js file under the ducks/groceries folder where I worked on the reducers and action creators for the removeItem, selectItem and deselectItem

In the src/components folder I edited the ListContainer.jsx file and included the imports and propTypes for all the actions.
AddItem, selectItem, deselectItem.Most of the logic is captured in the here which I have included ample commentary. 

Also worked with the other components that helped for smooth rendering on the scnree ListInputs, ListSelection and ListTable

Thanks for reading!
